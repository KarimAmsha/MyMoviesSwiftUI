# TV Shows App

This repository contains an iOS application built using SwiftUI. The app utilizes the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern along with the RXSwift library. The app fetches data from the TMDB API to display a list of TV shows and allows users to view detailed information about each show.

## Features

- Fetches TV show data from the TMDB API.
- Displays a list of TV shows with their titles, posters, and ratings.
- Allows users to select a TV show to view more details.
- Shows additional information about the selected TV show.
- Provides a clean and user-friendly interface for browsing and exploring TV shows.

## Technologies Used

- SwiftUI: The app is built using SwiftUI, Apple's modern declarative framework for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms.
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern: The app follows the MVVM pattern to separate the concerns of data presentation and business logic. This helps maintain a clean and organized codebase.
- RXSwift: The app utilizes RXSwift to handle asynchronous operations, such as network requests and data binding. RXSwift provides a reactive programming paradigm that simplifies handling of asynchronous events and data streams.
- TMDB API: The app integrates with the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch TV show data. This includes retrieving a list of TV shows and detailed information for each show.
